## VLAN Connectivity Issue

### Problem:
PC1 and PC2, both in VLAN 10, cannot communicate.

### üîç Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check VLAN assignments:
   ```bash
   show vlan brief
   ```
   - If VLAN 10 is missing, add it:
     ```bash
     vlan 10
     name Engineering
     ```

2. Verify trunking on uplinks:
   ```bash
   show interfaces trunk
   ```
   - If VLAN 10 is not allowed, fix with:
     ```bash
     switchport trunk allowed vlan add 10
     ```

3. Ensure inter-VLAN routing is enabled (on L3 switch or router):
   ```bash
   show ip route
   ```

### Solution:
- VLAN 10 was not allowed on the trunk link.
- Fixed by adding VLAN 10 to the trunk using:
  ```bash
  switchport trunk allowed vlan add 10
  ```
```
