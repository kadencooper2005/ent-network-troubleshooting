   To address high latency or packet loss, I first checked for interface errors using show interfaces, Suspecting a duplex mismatch, I verified the interface settings with show interfaces F0/2 and found it set to half-duplex while the connecting device was on full-duplex. I resolved the issue by manually setting both sides to full-duplex using interface f0/2, followed by duplex full, and after clearing interface counters with clear counters, the errors stopped, improving performance.

Monitor CPU usage

    show processes cpu sorted
